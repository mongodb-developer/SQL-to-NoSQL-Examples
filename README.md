# SQL to NoSQL Examples

This repo contains two files that implement the same functionality.  They simulate retrieving user profile information from a database and updating it.  [UserProfile_MySQL.py](UserProfile_MySQL.py) works with a MySQL database and [UserProfile_MongoDB.py](UserProfile_MongoDB.py) works with a MongoDB database.
